      <div class="about-me1"> I am Shashwat Mishra mostly known by a more compact name Miku to pretty much
        everyone. I currently work as a Software engineer at Zemoso technologies pvt. ltd. Hyderabad
      </div>
      <div class="about-me2"> I'm from Vadodara, Gujarat. Which is what I would say if I believed the same myself. However
        owing to my extensively diverse history, I have had exposure to many cultures and that has made me incapable
        of identifying with any one culture. Handy.
      </div>
      <div class="about-me3"> I absolutely adore vehicles and technology and anything generating over 100 horsepower
        per litre of displacement sets my heart racing <3
